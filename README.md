# Overview
The Sewaans.id application is my new application project that allows users to be able to borrow or lend goods. why did i make this app? I want everyone to be able to easily feel things that have never been theirs, by spending a little money to borrow an item, the user can feel an item that he has never owned or for some other purpose. other users can also become borrowers and he will get a 90% commission every time someone borrows his belongings. of course this will be a new breakthrough, and this application is open source.
